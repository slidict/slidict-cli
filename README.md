# Slidict

Generate presentation source files from a simple conversation.

Slidict is a CLI tool that helps you turn rough ideas into presentations through AI-guided conversations.

Unlike traditional slide generators, Slidict focuses on communication before slide creation.

## Features

- Interactive CLI conversation
- Generate slides for Slidev, Marp, Asciidoctor Reveal.js, and other OSS presentation frameworks
- Local-first MVP implemented in Ruby
- Built-in Sinatra server for browsing generated slides from `public/`
- OpenAI Compatible API support, so you can point Slidict at OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or any other server implementing the same `/chat/completions` endpoint

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.1 or later

## Usage

Run the executable directly from this repository:

```bash
bin/slidict
```

Slidict asks a few questions and generates presentation source files. For example, this creates a Marp Markdown deck:

```bash
$ bin/slidict --framework marp

What would you like to talk about?
> PDF Difference Monitoring Service
How long is the presentation?
> 5 minutes
Who is the audience?
> Engineering managers
What should the audience remember or do?
> Approve an MVP pilot
Created public/001.md
```

You can also provide answers non-interactively:

```bash
bin/slidict \
  --topic "PDF Difference Monitoring Service" \
  --duration "5 minutes" \
  --audience "Engineering managers" \
  --goal "Approve an MVP pilot" \
  --framework asciidoctor-revealjs \
  --output slides.adoc
```

Add `--publish` to also save the generated slides to slidict.io as a draft (requires
`slidict auth` first). Pass `--slide-id` to edit an existing draft instead of creating a
new one:

```bash
# Create a new draft on slidict.io from the generated slides
bin/slidict --topic "PDF Difference Monitoring Service" --duration "5 minutes" \
  --audience "Engineering managers" --goal "Approve an MVP pilot" --publish

# Edit an existing draft (slide #42) instead of creating a new one
bin/slidict --topic "PDF Difference Monitoring Service" --duration "5 minutes" \
  --audience "Engineering managers" --goal "Approve an MVP pilot" --slide-id 42
```

## Output files

Choose the framework and output path that match the presentation tool you want to use. If you omit `--output`, Slidict writes under `public/` with the next sequential file name. Use `--filename` to choose the relative file name under `public/`; Slidict appends the framework extension when the name has no extension.

```bash
# Choose a served file name under public/
bin/slidict --filename product-demo/slides --topic "Product Demo"
```

```text
Slidev                  -> public/001.md, public/002.md, ...
Marp                    -> public/001.md, public/002.md, ...
Asciidoctor Reveal.js   -> public/001.adoc, public/002.adoc, ...
```

## Commands

### `slidict auth`

Authenticates the CLI with your GitHub account via the device code flow and saves a
CLI access token to `~/.config/slidict/credentials.json`.

```bash
bin/slidict auth
```

### `slidict slides`

Manage your slides on slidict.io using the CLI access token saved by `slidict auth`.

```bash
bin/slidict slides list [--page N]
bin/slidict slides show <id>
bin/slidict slides create [--title TEXT] [--body TEXT | --file PATH] [--body-format asciidoc|markdown] [--visibility public|unlisted|group_only]
bin/slidict slides edit <id> [--title TEXT] [--body TEXT | --file PATH] [--body-format asciidoc|markdown] [--visibility public|unlisted|group_only]
```

- `create` and `edit` always save the slide as a draft. Publishing requires going through
  the moderation flow on the Web UI; the CLI cannot publish a slide.
- `edit` only works on slides that are still drafts; editing an already-published slide
  must be done from the Web UI.
- `create`/`edit` are rate limited to once per minute per user.

Run `bin/slidict slides -h` for the full list of options.

### `slidict serve`

Serve generated slide files from the local `public/` directory with Sinatra. The top
page lists Markdown and Asciidoc slide files below `public/`, so you can organize
decks in subdirectories such as `public/product-demo/slides.md`. Any arguments
after `serve` are passed through to Sinatra.

```bash
bin/slidict serve -p 4567 -o 0.0.0.0
```

`bin/slidict --publish` and `--slide-id` (see [Usage](#usage)) wrap this same `create`/`edit`
behavior so you can save the slides you just generated straight to slidict.io.

## Configuration

Slidict generates slides with an LLM through any OpenAI Compatible API. Configure the
target endpoint with environment variables or CLI flags (flags take precedence):

| Environment variable    | CLI flag         | Default        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |
| `SLIDICT_LLM_BASE_URL`    | `--llm-base-url` | _(none)_       |
| `SLIDICT_LLM_API_KEY`     | `--llm-api-key`  | _(none)_       |
| `SLIDICT_LLM_MODEL`       | `--llm-model`    | `gpt-4o-mini`  |

If no `llm-base-url` is configured, Slidict uses its built-in slide template and never
calls an LLM. Once a `llm-base-url` is set, Slidict always calls that endpoint; if the
request fails, Slidict reports the error and exits without writing a file (no fallback).
You can force the template even when a base URL is configured with `--no-llm`.

Examples:

```bash
# OpenAI
export SLIDICT_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
export SLIDICT_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
bin/slidict --topic "PDF Difference Monitoring Service" --duration "5 minutes" \
  --audience "Engineering managers" --goal "Approve an MVP pilot"

# Ollama (running locally, OpenAI Compatible API)
bin/slidict --llm-base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --llm-api-key ollama --llm-model llama3

# LM Studio (running locally, OpenAI Compatible API)
bin/slidict --llm-base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 --llm-api-key lm-studio --llm-model local-model
```

## Philosophy

Slidict helps you communicate ideas, not just create slides.

Many presentation tools focus on layouts, themes, and visual design.

Slidict focuses on the message.

Before generating slides, Slidict helps you:

- Clarify your message
- Build a compelling narrative
- Focus on what matters
- Create presentations people remember

```text

Conversation

```

We optimize for communication, not decoration.

## Roadmap

- [x] Interactive CLI
- [x] Slide generation
- [x] OpenAI Compatible API support (configurable base URL, so Ollama, LM Studio, and other compatible servers work out of the box)
